# NeMo-RL Assets Repository

This repository contains essential supplementary files required for running custom Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using the [NeMo-RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemo-rl) framework.

It is meant to be used alongside the main NeMo-RL project to ensure a reproducible and consistent setup.
